# All Mangas Reader V2

## Why a V2 ?
All Mangas Reader is a browser extension which is designed to help you read and follow mangas on a lot of manga websites.
The first version, created in 2012, is no more maintained due to poor code design.
All Mangas Reader V2 has been created to solve the two main issues of the V1 : 
 - Chrome removed AMR from its store because of terms service violation. Since then, a lot of workarounds have been found to install AMR, but its more difficult to install.
**All Mangas Reader V2 is supported by Firefox, Chrome (Chromium, Canary), Opera, and Edge once it will implement properly native Promises**
 - The code was really difficult to maintain because of really long and unreadable files full of jQuery code without comments
**All Mangas Reader has been fully rewritten with modern standards (ES6 (Babel), Webpack, VueJS) and is well documented**
